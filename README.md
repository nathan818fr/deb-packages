# nathan818's deb-packages

This repository contains scripts to create simple Debian packages for some
softwares that I use.

Scripts are set up to run periodically with GitHub Actions. This way, if a new
version of a supported software is released, a new package is automatically
created. The packages are stored as [GitHub Releases assets][github-releases].

This repository is primarily for my own use. **I don't provide support. I don't
add software on request.**
